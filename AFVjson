The T-80BV is famous for the myth of its poor performance in Chechnya, records of T-80 and T-72 losses barely differ, it was just due to the embarrassment that it was blamed, the Russian Army failed to blame the poor crew training and corruption, a lot of tanks went in to Grozny with no ERA due to the plastic explosive being sold off by crews.",
