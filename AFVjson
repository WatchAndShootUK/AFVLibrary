The gunners primary sight is a prominent rectangle on the left side of the turret, with a large box shape elevated behind his hatch, this is part of active protection system. The commander has a panoramic sight in front of his hatch with a meteorological sensor behind his hatch, above the 125mm MA you’ll see a small box, this is again part of the active protection system. On the turret sides you’ll see the SGD’s with a bank of 5 either side, behind that is a large ERA fitting around the bustle rack.": "rfeattype99a1",

The driver has 2 periscopes, the right periscope is smaller than the left, the hull gradually slopes upwards as it goes to the back, giving a raised superstructure look at the rear like an M1 Abrams series of MBT’s. There are 2 small square exhausts on either side. Along the hull sides there are 5 square holes, presumably footsteps, the tank has 6 roadwheels with prominent gaps between the 3rd-4th and 4th-5th.": "rfeattype99a2",
