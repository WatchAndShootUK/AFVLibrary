            "kontakt-14": "In this diagram by V.A Grigoryan you can see how Kontakt-1 works. The operating principle of the armour lies in the disruption of shaped charge jets through the violent separation of the steel plates sandwiching the explosive layer upon detonation. The column of numbers 'N' to the left indicates the number of reactive plates that a shaped charge jet must pass through depending on the point of impact."
